        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The Service</h2>
      <p>
        PipeKeeper is an adult-focused collection-management and informational
        application designed to help users catalog, organize, and document
        pipes, cellar inventories, accessories, and related collection data.
        PipeKeeper does not sell tobacco products, does not facilitate tobacco
        purchases, and does not process tobacco orders.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be legally able to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction
        to use the Service. You are solely responsible for complying with all

        possession of items documented within the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You

        information updated.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Subscriptions, Premium Features, and Trials</h2>
      <p>
        PipeKeeper may offer optional Premium features through paid
        subscriptions. Limited trial access may be offered and will be clearly
        displayed within the Service when applicable.

          <strong>iOS:</strong> Subscriptions are processed through Apple’s App
          Store In-App Purchase system and managed via your Apple ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web and Android:</strong> Subscriptions are processed by
          PipeKeeper through secure third-party payment providers and managed
          through your account profile.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Subscription features, pricing, and availability may vary by platform.</p>

      <h2>5. Billing and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Billing and refund handling depend on the platform used to purchase a
        subscription. iOS purchases are subject to Apple’s billing and refund
