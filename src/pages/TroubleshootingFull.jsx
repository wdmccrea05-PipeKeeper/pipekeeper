        },
        {
          q: "How does tobacco-pipe matching work?",

          q: "What if AI recommendations don't match my preferences?",

          q: "Which tool should I use: Geometry Analysis or Verified Specs?",

        {
          q: "Geometry analysis shows low confidence",
          a: "Low confidence means the AI is uncertain. This happens when: photos are unclear/missing, pipe is a unique freehand design, or dimensions are missing. Results still appear so you can review and decide. You can apply suggestions or enter data manually."
        },
        {
          q: "Find Verified Specs returns 'No specs found'",
          a: "This is normal for artisan pipes, estate pipes, or uncommon models. The tool only finds data from manufacturer catalogs. Use 'Analyze Geometry from Photos' instead - it's the primary tool and works from your uploaded images and dimensions."

        {
          q: "When should I use Virginia/Perique vs VaPer?",
          a: "Virginia/Perique is the standard term for blends with Virginia base and Perique condiment. VaPer is just shorthand for the same thing."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I classify a complex blend with many tobaccos?",
          a: "Choose the category based on the dominant characteristic. If it has Latakia, it's likely English or Balkan. If heavily topped, it's Aromatic."

          q: "What's a 'Codger Blend'?",

          q: "How should I tag my pipe's focus?",
          a: "Be specific! Use tags like 'Virginia', 'English', 'Aromatics', 'VaPer', or 'Latakia Blend'. You can add intensity like 'Heavy Aromatics' or 'Light Aromatics'."
        },
        {
          q: "Should I dedicate pipes to specific blends?",
          a: "Recommended for strongly flavored blends (Lakeland, heavy aromatics, Latakia). Virginias and VaPers can share pipes more easily."
        },
        {
          q: "What does 'Utility' or 'Versatile' mean?",
          a: "These tags tell the AI this pipe can handle multiple blend types. Good for rotation pipes that you use for various tobaccos."
        },
        {
          q: "Can a pipe have multiple focus tags?",

        },
        {
          q: "How does focus affect pairing scores?",
          a: "The AI gives higher scores to blends that match your focus tags. Aromatic-only pipes get 0 score for non-aromatics and vice versa."

        {
          q: "What if I don't know what to focus my pipe on?",

          a: "The cellared card multiplies each blend's value (manual_market_value or ai_estimated_value) by its cellared quantity from the Cellar Log. Value is per-ounce, so total value = value_per_oz × cellared_oz."
