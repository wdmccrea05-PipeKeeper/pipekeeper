/**
 * PIPEKEEPER QA & REGRESSION TESTING CHECKLIST
 * Version: 2026-02-03
 * Run before each release to production
 */

// ============================================
// CRITICAL PATH 1: DATA CONSISTENCY
// ============================================

/**
 * TEST 1.1: Tobacco Quantity Totals Match Everywhere
 * Expected: Home stats, TobaccoCollectionStats, CSV exports all show IDENTICAL totals
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Add tobacco with: 2 tins (1.75oz each), 5oz bulk, 1 pouch (1.5oz)
 * 2. Add CellarLog: +3.5oz tin (added), -1oz tin (removed)
 * 3. Check Home "Cellar Breakdown" card → Should show net cellared from CellarLog
 * 4. Navigate to Tobacco page → Open Stats → Check "Total Inventory"
 * 5. Export CSV from Tobacco page → Compare totals
 * 
 * Expected Outcome:
 * - Total = 3.5oz + 5oz + 1.5oz = 10oz (from TobaccoBlend fields)
 * - Cellared (from logs) = 3.5oz - 1oz = 2.5oz
 * - All three views MUST MATCH
 * 
 * Canonical Functions:
 * - calculateTotalOzFromBlend(blend) → total inventory
 * - calculateCellaredOzFromLogs(logs, blendId) → cellared from ledger
 */

/**
 * TEST 1.2: Pairing Scores Consistent
 * Expected: Same pipe+blend yields same score in PairingMatrix, MatchingEngine, TopBlendMatches
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create aromatic-focused pipe
 * 2. Create 2 blends: "1792 Flake" (non-aromatic), "Lane 1-Q" (aromatic)
 * 3. Generate Pairing Matrix
 * 4. Check score for aromatic pipe + 1792 Flake → Should be 0 (filtered)
 * 5. Navigate to pipe detail → MatchingEngine → Verify same score
 * 6. Open PairingMatrix grid → Verify top 3 sorted descending
 * 
 * Expected Outcome:
 * - Aromatic pipe + non-aromatic blend = 0 (always filtered)
 * - Same blend = same score across all views
 * - Top 3 always sorted highest to lowest
 * 
 * Canonical Function:
 * - scorePipeBlend() from pairingScoreCanonical.js
 */

/**
 * TEST 1.3: Cellar Drift Detection
 * Expected: Drift alert appears when TobaccoBlend rollup doesn't match CellarLog ledger
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create blend with 5 tins cellared (manual entry)
 * 2. Add CellarLog: +2 tins added (3.5oz), +1 tin added (1.75oz)
 * 3. Navigate to Tobacco page
 * 4. Should see drift alert banner: "2 blend(s) have cellared amounts that don't match"
 * 5. Click "View Details" → Should show difference
 * 6. Click "Reconcile All" → Should update to match logs (5.25oz)
 * 7. Drift alert should disappear
 * 8. Run reconcile again → Should be idempotent (no changes)
 * 
 * Expected Outcome:
 * - Drift detected when logs ≠ entity fields (tolerance 0.1oz)
 * - Reconcile updates ONLY tin_tins_cellared, bulk_cellared, pouch_pouches_cellared
 * - Notes, names, metadata NEVER touched
 * - Idempotent: running twice = same result
